# Air Quality Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes air quality data to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to environmental conditions.  
The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Summary statistics and outlier detection  
- Visualizations for pollutant distributions  
- Initial predictive modeling  

The work was developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook as part of my Master’s in Data Analytics.


## Repository Structure
- `AirQualityProject.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis  
- `AirQualityDataset.csv` → Dataset used for the analysis  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  


## Technologies and Tools
- Programming: Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook  


## Key Insights
- Outliers in nutrient and energy values were identified and removed to improve model stability.  
- Statistical analysis revealed significant variations in pollutant levels across different observations.  
- Visualization techniques (boxplots, histograms, heatmaps) were applied to improve dataset understanding.
